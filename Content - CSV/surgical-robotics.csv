endoscopic-device-testing,Endoscopic Device Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Surgical Robotics Testing,/preclinical-services/surgical-robotics-testing,Endoscopic Device Testing Services,"Successful endoscopy depends on cameras that see tissue clearly, flexible shafts that navigate anatomy without breaking, and components that survive repeated cleaning cycles. We test optical resolution per ISO 8600 standards, measure mechanical durability through thousands of bending cycles, and validate that your scope maintains performance after the cleaning protocols hospitals actually use.",What We Test,"Endoscopic cameras must resolve enough detail for accurate diagnosis while maintaining color accuracy under varying light conditions. The flexible insertion tube must bend through tight turns without kinking, transmit physician hand movements precisely to the tip, and return to its original shape after each procedure. Meanwhile, working channels must stay patent for instrument passage, and the entire system must withstand hundreds of cleaning and sterilization cycles without degrading optical or mechanical performance.

We measure image resolution across your camera's full field of view using ISO 8600 test patterns. Mechanical testing quantifies minimum bending radius, torque transmission from handle to tip, and structural integrity after 10,000+ flexion cycles. We validate that seals maintain integrity during high-pressure cleaning, that optical components resist fogging and contamination, and that electrical insulation remains intact throughout your scope's claimed lifetime. Testing follows protocols specific to GI, bronchial, urological, and laparoscopic applications.

Your regulatory pathway depends on demonstrating that optical performance meets diagnostic requirements, mechanical components survive clinical use patterns, and biocompatibility testing addresses mucosal contact duration per ISO 10993. We provide the data packages needed for 510(k) submissions, with protocols designed around FDA guidance for flexible endoscopes and the specific contact scenarios your device encounters during procedures.",Key Testing Capabilities,Optical Resolution Testing,"We measure how many line pairs per millimeter your camera resolves at center and periphery, quantifying whether image quality supports diagnostic decisions across the full viewing area per ISO 8600 standards.",Mechanical Flexibility Validation,"We determine the tightest radius your scope navigates without kinking or breaking, measuring insertion force, torque response, and whether the shaft maintains flexibility after repeated bending to maximum specifications.",Channel Patency Assessment,"We verify that working channels pass instruments of specified diameters, maintain suction capacity, and resist blockage from tissue or fluid debris during simulated procedures.",Cleaning Validation Testing,"We measure whether your scope's design allows complete removal of organic matter from channels and components, using the automated reprocessing systems hospitals actually employ.",Illumination Uniformity Measurement,"We quantify light distribution across your scope's field of view, measuring whether illumination intensity varies enough to create diagnostic blind spots or misleading shadows.",Biocompatibility Evaluation,"We conduct ISO 10993 cytotoxicity, sensitization, and irritation testing based on mucosal contact duration, providing the safety data required for tissue-contacting components.",Why Choose Synchrony for Endoscopic Device Testing,FlaskConical,Flexible Catheter Testing Infrastructure,"Our facility includes specialized equipment for testing devices that must navigate complex anatomy. We measure bending performance using radius fixtures from 5mm to 50mm, quantify torque transmission through articulated shafts, and evaluate tip control precision. This infrastructure applies directly to endoscopic insertion tubes, which face the same mechanical challenges as the cardiovascular catheters we've tested for 40 years.",Eye,Optical Performance Measurement Capabilities,"We maintain ISO 8600-compliant optical test benches with resolution targets, color charts, and illumination measurement systems. Our equipment quantifies resolution, contrast sensitivity, and color reproduction under controlled conditions.

laparoscopic-testing,Laparoscopic Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Surgical Robotics Testing,/preclinical-services/surgical-robotics-testing,Laparoscopic Testing Services,"Successful laparoscopic surgery requires instruments where electrical insulation never fails during tissue cutting, trocar seals maintain pneumoperitoneum throughout procedures, and articulation joints deliver precise movements after thousands of cycles. We test whether your electrosurgical insulation withstands the mechanical stress of tissue manipulation, measure how much force surgeons need to actuate your instrument, and validate that seals prevent gas leakage under the pressure conditions surgeons actually encounter.",What We Test,"Laparoscopic instruments combine mechanical precision with electrical safety in an environment where insulation failure can cause serious patient injury. Electrosurgical devices must deliver cutting or coagulation energy while maintaining complete insulation integrity along shaft lengths of 30-45cm. Articulating instruments must transmit hand movements through multiple joints without backlash or position drift. Trocars must seal around instruments of varying diameters while maintaining 12-15 mmHg insufflation pressure. All components must survive repeated sterilization cycles without performance degradation.

We measure insulation resistance per IEC 60601 standards, applying mechanical stress while monitoring for current leakage that could cause patient burns. Mechanical testing quantifies actuation forces at the handle, jaw closure forces at the tip, and whether articulation accuracy degrades after 5,000+ cycles. We validate trocar seal performance across instrument diameter ranges, measure CO2 leak rates during simulated instrument exchanges, and verify that valve mechanisms maintain function after repeated autoclaving. Testing addresses general surgery, gynecological, and urological applications.

Your device typically follows a 510(k) pathway demonstrating substantial equivalence to predicate instruments.
