Pacemakers must detect intrinsic cardiac activity while delivering therapy that maintains adequate heart rate without depleting battery reserves prematurely. Single-chamber systems demand precise ventricular pacing validation while dual-chamber platforms require complex atrial-ventricular synchronization assessment and rate-responsive devices need sensor algorithm verification across activity levels.

We evaluate electrical performance using specialized electrophysiology systems that capture pacing thresholds, sensing amplitudes, and impedance measurements with microsecond precision. Our catheterization laboratories feature programmable cardiac simulation systems enabling comprehensive pacing mode assessment and rate adaptation testing. Lead system testing evaluates conductor durability through accelerated fatigue protocols while biocompatibility assessment addresses chronic tissue contact requirements using ISO 10993 standards adapted for active implantable devices.
