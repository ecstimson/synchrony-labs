glp-testing,GLP Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Medical Device Testing,/preclinical-services/medical-device-testing,GLP Testing Services,"Successful FDA submissions require preclinical data generated under protocols that FDA trusts, with documentation that survives regulatory inspection. We conduct studies under 21 CFR Part 58 Good Laboratory Practice standards, maintaining the quality assurance oversight, audit trails, and protocol adherence that FDA expects.",What We Test,"FDA reviewers reject submissions when they can't verify how data was collected, who collected it, or whether protocols were followed. GLP protocols create an unbreakable chain of custody from the moment a study begins until the final report reaches FDA. Every measurement, observation, and data point gets documented with timestamps, signatures, and audit trails that prove your preclinical data is reliable.

We follow written protocols approved before any work begins, and our Quality Assurance Unit operates independently from study teams to verify compliance. Studies are directed by qualified scientists who ensure protocol adherence, while automated systems capture data with built-in verification. Equipment gets calibrated on documented schedules, and any protocol deviations require written justification before they happen.

21 CFR Part 58 establishes the framework FDA uses to evaluate whether preclinical data is trustworthy. Studies conducted under these regulations create documentation that survives FDA inspection, including complete records of raw data, protocol amendments, and quality assurance audits. This standard applies to safety studies supporting 510(k) clearances, PMA approvals, and IDE applications across all device types.",Key Testing Capabilities,Independent Quality Assurance Oversight,"Quality Assurance Unit reviews protocols before studies begin, monitors ongoing compliance, and audits final reports to ensure every aspect meets 21 CFR Part 58 requirements.",Complete Audit Trail Documentation,"Electronic data capture systems maintain audit trails showing who entered data, when they entered it, and what changes were made throughout the study lifecycle.",Equipment Calibration Programs,"Documented calibration schedules, verification records, and traceability to national standards that FDA inspectors expect to see during facility inspections.",Qualified Study Director Oversight,"Study directors trained in GLP regulations maintain responsibility for protocol adherence, data integrity, and compliance throughout the study duration.",Comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures,"Written procedures covering every aspect of study conduct, from protocol development through final report archiving, ensuring consistency across all GLP studies.",Secure Archive Systems,"Controlled storage that preserves raw data, protocols, and final reports for FDA-specified retention periods, with access controls and environmental monitoring.",Why Choose Synchrony for GLP Testing,Shield,Purpose-Built GLP Infrastructure,"Our facility was designed specifically for cardiovascular device testing under GLP compliance, with two catheterization laboratories and environmental monitoring systems that document temperature, humidity, and air quality continuously.

biocompatibility,Biocompatibility Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Medical Device Testing,/preclinical-services/medical-device-testing,Biocompatibility Testing Services,"Success with blood-contacting devices depends on proving your materials don't trigger clotting, cause cell damage, or produce allergic reactions that compromise patient safety. We conduct ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing with protocols adapted for cardiovascular applications, measuring biological responses that determine whether FDA accepts your device materials as safe for human use.",What We Test,"Device materials interact with blood, tissue, and immune systems in ways that standard engineering tests cannot predict. Biocompatibility testing measures whether your materials damage cells in laboratory culture, whether they trigger immune responses that cause inflammation or allergic reactions, and whether blood clots form when it contacts your device surface. These biological responses determine patient safety and regulatory approval for any device that touches human tissue.

We test cytotoxicity by exposing cells to your device materials and measuring cell death or metabolic damage. Hemocompatibility protocols measure platelet activation, complement system triggering, and clot formation when blood contacts device surfaces. Sensitization studies determine whether materials cause allergic reactions, while systemic toxicity testing evaluates effects on organs and body systems after device implantation.

ISO 10993 establishes the testing framework FDA requires, with specific protocols selected based on how long your device contacts tissue and where it's used in the body. Blood-contacting devices require hemocompatibility testing that surface-contact devices don't need. Permanent implants require long-term tissue response studies. We design testing matrices that address your specific device characteristics while meeting the standards FDA reviewers expect to see.",Key Testing Capabilities,Cytotoxicity Testing (ISO 10993-5),"We expose cell cultures to device materials and measure cell viability, membrane integrity, and metabolic function to detect materials that cause cellular damage.",Hemocompatibility Assessment,"Blood compatibility protocols measure platelet activation, thrombus formation, complement system triggering, and hemolysis to evaluate thrombosis risk for blood-contacting devices.",Sensitization and Irritation Testing (ISO 10993-10),"Studies determine whether device materials trigger allergic reactions or cause tissue irritation, using validated protocols that FDA accepts for regulatory submissions.",Systemic Toxicity Evaluation (ISO 10993-11),"Testing measures effects on major organ systems and overall health following device exposure, identifying potential systemic safety concerns before clinical use.",Implantation Testing (ISO 10993-6),"Protocols evaluate local tissue responses to implanted materials, measuring inflammation, tissue integration, and long-term compatibility for permanently implanted devices.",Material Characterization and Extract Testing,"Chemical analysis identifies leachable compounds from device materials, while extract testing evaluates biological responses to substances that may migrate from devices into tissue.",Why Choose Synchrony for Biocompatibility Testing,Microscope,Cardiovascular-Specific Testing Protocols,"We've adapted ISO 10993 protocols specifically for blood-contacting cardiovascular devices, understanding that standard surface-contact testing doesn't capture thrombosis risk or complement activation that determines safety for devices in the bloodstream.

fda-regulatory-testing,FDA Regulatory Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Medical Device Testing,/preclinical-services/medical-device-testing,FDA Regulatory Testing Services,"Successful FDA submissions depend on testing that answers the specific questions reviewers ask about your device type, using methods they recognize and trust. We design preclinical testing strategies aligned with current FDA guidance documents, consensus standards, and regulatory pathway requirements that generate data reviewers evaluate.",What We Test,"FDA reviewers evaluate whether your testing demonstrates safety and effectiveness for the specific claims you're making. A 510(k) clearance requires showing your device works like an approved predicate through comparative testing. PMA approval demands comprehensive safety databases and effectiveness evidence from pivotal studies. IDE applications need preclinical data proving it's safe to begin human testing. Each pathway has distinct evidence requirements that determine which tests FDA expects to see.

We design testing strategies based on FDA guidance documents specific to your device type, whether that's heart valves following specific durability protocols, stents requiring fracture resistance testing, or novel devices needing risk-based testing approaches. Testing includes biocompatibility per ISO 10993, performance validation using ASTM or ISO consensus standards, and safety assessment addressing known device risks. All studies follow GLP protocols that create the documentation FDA trusts.

Your regulatory pathway determines testing scope and endpoints. 510(k) substantial equivalence testing compares your device directly to predicate performance. PMA studies require statistically powered safety and effectiveness endpoints. Breakthrough designation or De Novo pathways need innovative testing approaches that address novel technologies.
