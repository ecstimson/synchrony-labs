liquid-embolic-device-testing,Liquid Embolic Device Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Neurovascular Testing,/preclinical-services/neurovascular-testing,Liquid Embolic Device Testing Services,"Liquid embolic agents face unique validation challenges requiring polymer viscosity measurement, radiopacity verification, and polymerization timing control that standard biocompatibility testing cannot address. We test DMSO compatibility, tantalum suspension stability, controlled precipitation behavior, and tissue uptake patterns across aneurysm, AVM, and peripheral embolization applications for both 510(k) and PMA submissions.",What We Test,"Liquid embolic agents must solidify at precisely the right speed during deployment. Too fast and the polymer blocks your delivery catheter. Too slow and it flows beyond the target vessel before hardening. We test how viscosity changes during injection, measure polymerization timing under different conditions, and verify that tantalum particles stay suspended throughout the procedure so your device remains visible under fluoroscopy. We track polymer behavior using real-time imaging that captures precipitation patterns as liquid transitions to solid. DMSO compatibility testing ensures your carrier solvent doesn't damage microcatheters during extended procedures. Advanced tissue analysis measures how deeply the polymer penetrates vessel walls and surrounding tissue. Our protocols evaluate coating uniformity, radiopacity across different thicknesses, and complete occlusion effectiveness in anatomically accurate aneurysm models. ISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material evaluation while device-specific protocols address DMSO toxicity, polymer degradation, and tissue response at embolization sites.

thrombectomy-testing,Thrombectomy Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Neurovascular Testing,/preclinical-services/neurovascular-testing,Thrombectomy Testing Services,"Successful thrombectomy requires devices that grab clots effectively, retrieve them without vessel damage, and achieve complete recanalization on the first attempt. We test stent retriever deployment mechanics, aspiration force generation, clot extraction efficiency, and first-pass success rates across stroke, MI, and peripheral thrombosis applications for both 510(k) and PMA submissions.",What We Test,"Thrombectomy devices must grab clots effectively without tearing blood vessels during retrieval. Stent retrievers need to expand precisely to engage thrombus while maintaining vessel wall contact. Aspiration catheters must generate enough suction to pull clots out without fragmenting them. We test how devices perform across fresh platelet-rich clots and older organized thrombi because different clot types require different removal forces and techniques. Our protocols measure clot engagement success using force sensors that track how well devices capture thrombus during deployment. High-speed imaging documents retrieval mechanics while tracking whether clots break apart and send fragments downstream. We evaluate vessel preservation by measuring endothelial damage after multiple retrieval attempts. Anatomically accurate stroke models replicate cerebral vessel tortuosity while pulsatile flow systems simulate physiological conditions during emergency procedures. ISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material safety evaluation while thrombectomy-specific protocols assess rapid deployment requirements and emergency use scenarios.

direct-aspiration-thrombectomy-testing,Direct Aspiration Thrombectomy Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Neurovascular Testing,/preclinical-services/neurovascular-testing,Direct Aspiration Thrombectomy Testing Services,"Aspiration thrombectomy success depends on generating sufficient vacuum force, maintaining catheter trackability through tortuous vessels, and extracting clots without fragmentation. We test suction pressure generation, catheter navigation performance, clot extraction efficiency across fresh and organized thrombi, and complete recanalization achievement for stroke, coronary, and peripheral applications supporting both 510(k) and PMA pathways.",What We Test,"Direct aspiration catheters must generate enough suction to pull clots from occluded vessels while staying flexible enough to navigate tortuous anatomy. Too much vacuum and the catheter collapses inward. Too little and clots won't budge. We measure how much negative pressure your catheter generates at different flow rates and track whether that suction stays consistent during extended procedures across varying catheter diameters and lengths. Our protocols test extraction success across different clot types because fresh platelet-rich thrombi extract differently than organized fibrin material. Force measurement systems track how much suction each clot composition requires while high-speed imaging documents whether clots come out intact or fragment during aspiration. We evaluate catheter deliverability through anatomically accurate stroke models that replicate cerebral vessel tortuosity. Pulsatile flow systems simulate physiological conditions that affect vacuum transmission from pump to catheter tip.
