des-testing,Drug-Eluting Stent Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Coronary Stent Testing,/preclinical-services/cardiovascular-disease-testing/coronary-stent-testing,Drug-Eluting Stent Testing Services,"Drug-eluting stents face unique validation challenges as combination products requiring both device and drug assessment. We test drug release patterns, polymer coating performance, tissue uptake levels, and vascular healing across paclitaxel, sirolimus, and everolimus platforms for both 510(k) and PMA submissions.",What We Test,"Drug-eluting stents require validation beyond mechanical testing because the polymer coating must release drug at precise rates while staying intact during deployment. The drug needs to reach vessel walls at therapeutic levels that prevent restenosis without causing toxicity. This combination product challenge means we test both device mechanics and drug delivery together, validating how the coating performs during balloon expansion and how effectively the drug penetrates arterial tissue.

We track drug release using HPLC analysis that measures elution over time under flow conditions that match coronary arteries. Scanning electron microscopy shows coating uniformity across stent struts while tissue samples reveal drug concentration in vessel walls. Our testing captures how drugs like paclitaxel and sirolimus distribute through arterial layers, measuring the tissue levels that determine whether the stent prevents smooth muscle cell growth effectively.

Drug-eluting stents follow FDA combination product rules requiring coordination between device and drug review centers. We conduct ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing adapted for drug-eluting systems while ISO 25539 guides mechanical validation. Our protocols address both 510(k) pathways comparing to predicate devices and PMA submissions for breakthrough technologies. Testing demonstrates that polymer coatings maintain drug stability through sterilization and shelf life while delivering therapeutic benefit during vascular healing.",Key Testing Capabilities,Drug Release Measurement,"HPLC analysis tracks how drug releases over time under flow conditions matching coronary arteries, measuring burst release in the first 24 hours and sustained delivery through the healing phase to confirm therapeutic levels reach vessel tissue.",Polymer Coating Validation,"Scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing evaluate coating thickness, uniformity across stent struts, and adhesion strength during balloon expansion to ensure coating stays intact during deployment without cracking or peeling.",Tissue Drug Uptake Analysis,"Quantitative tissue analysis measures drug concentrations in arterial wall layers, mapping how deeply drugs like paclitaxel and sirolimus penetrate to reach smooth muscle cells where they prevent restenosis.",Mechanical and Coating Integrity,"Combined testing evaluates stent radial strength, recoil behavior, and coating integrity simultaneously during deployment to ensure mechanical forces don't damage the polymer coating or affect drug delivery.",Combination Product Biocompatibility,"ISO 10993 testing adapted for drug-eluting systems evaluates both polymer biocompatibility and drug effects on tissue, addressing local tolerance and systemic safety specific to combination product requirements.",Regulatory Pathway Support,"Testing protocols address FDA combination product guidance requiring both device center and drug center review, generating data for 510(k) pathways through predicate comparison or PMA submissions for breakthrough technologies.",Why Choose Synchrony for Drug-Eluting Stent Testing,Microscope,Specialized Drug Analysis Infrastructure,"Our laboratories feature HPLC systems configured specifically for drug-eluting stent analysis, scanning electron microscopy for coating characterization, and quantitative tissue analysis equipment for measuring drug penetration. This specialized analytical infrastructure enables precise drug release profiling, polymer coating assessment, and tissue uptake measurement that combination products require for FDA approval.",Users,Combination Product Expertise,"Drug-eluting stents require expertise in both device mechanics and pharmaceutical delivery that most facilities don't have.
