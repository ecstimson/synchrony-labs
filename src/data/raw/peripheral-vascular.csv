carotid-stent-testing,Carotid Stent Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Peripheral Vascular Testing,/preclinical-services/peripheral-vascular-testing,Carotid Stent Testing Services,"Success in carotid stenting depends on opening blocked arteries without releasing plaque fragments that could cause stroke. We test how your device compresses plaque, measure particles released during deployment, track vessel scaffolding performance, and verify that cerebral blood flow remains adequate throughout the procedure.",What We Test,"Carotid stents face a unique challenge that doesn't exist in other vascular territories. The plaque you're treating is the same material that causes stroke if fragments break loose. Your device must compress unstable plaque against the vessel wall, maintain that compression long-term, and accomplish both without releasing particles into cerebral circulation. This requires testing that tracks embolic generation during every phase of deployment while verifying that the stent provides adequate vessel scaffolding.

We test carotid stents using anatomically accurate carotid bifurcation models with pulsatile flow systems that replicate cerebral circulation patterns. High-resolution particle tracking captures debris released during deployment and expansion, measuring both size and quantity of embolic material. Flow velocity measurement confirms adequate cerebral perfusion throughout the procedure, while radial force testing validates that your stent maintains plaque compression under arterial pressure. We evaluate both self-expanding nitinol designs and balloon-expandable systems across different stenosis severities and plaque compositions.

Our protocols align with FDA guidance for carotid stent devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Testing demonstrates embolic safety during deployment, adequate revascularization of the stenosed segment, and maintained vessel patency over time. We measure performance against ISO 25539 standards for cardiovascular stents, with specific emphasis on cerebrovascular safety parameters that distinguish carotid applications from coronary or peripheral use.",Key Testing Capabilities,Embolic Particle Tracking During Deployment,"We capture and measure every particle released when your stent compresses plaque, using real-time imaging to track debris size and quantity throughout deployment sequences that simulate clinical procedures.",Cerebral Flow Preservation Measurement,"Flow velocity sensors confirm that your device maintains adequate blood supply to the brain during deployment and after implantation, measuring pressure gradients across the treatment site under pulsatile flow conditions.",Plaque Compression Performance,"We test how effectively your stent secures unstable plaque against vessel walls without causing material extrusion through struts, evaluating compression force and coverage patterns across different plaque types.",Deployment Precision in Carotid Anatomy,"Anatomically accurate carotid bifurcation models validate that your delivery system positions the stent accurately at the stenosis site, with testing across various vessel sizes and anatomical configurations.",Self-Expansion Characteristics,"For nitinol designs, we measure deployment force, expansion timing, and chronic radial force maintenance to verify consistent performance across physiological temperature ranges and after catheter constraint.",Long-Term Scaffolding Durability,Accelerated fatigue testing simulates years of pulsatile pressure to confirm your stent maintains vessel support and plaque compression throughout the intended implantation period per ISO 25539 requirements.,Why Choose Synchrony for Carotid Stent Testing,Activity,Specialized Embolic Safety Infrastructure,"Our particle tracking systems capture debris down to 40 microns during simulated carotid procedures, providing the embolic safety data FDA requires for cerebrovascular devices.

aaa-device-testing,AAA Device Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Peripheral Vascular Testing,/preclinical-services/peripheral-vascular-testing,AAA Device Testing Services,"Successful aneurysm repair requires stent grafts that seal completely against vessel walls under continuous aortic pressure, prevent blood from leaking back into the aneurysm sac, and maintain that seal for years without migration. We test high-pressure containment performance, measure all four types of endoleaks, validate modular component integration, and confirm your device withstands the mechanical stresses of the aortic environment.",What We Test,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair presents a unique challenge in vascular intervention. Your stent graft must contain blood under the highest pressures in the body while sealing against vessel walls that may be irregular, calcified, or angulated. Any gap between the device and vessel wall creates an endoleak that defeats the purpose of the repair. The device must also resist the constant downward force of pulsatile blood flow that can cause migration over time.

We test AAA devices using high-pressure aortic simulators that replicate systolic pressures up to 200 mmHg with anatomically accurate aneurysm models. Pressure sensors throughout the system detect any blood flow into the aneurysm sac, identifying Type I endoleaks at attachment zones, Type II leaks from branch vessels, Type III leaks between modular components, and Type IV leaks through graft material. We measure the force required to dislodge your device, test seal integrity across different neck angulations and diameters, and run accelerated fatigue cycles that simulate decades of cardiac pulsation. Both modular multi-component systems and unibody designs undergo testing across the anatomical variations you'll encounter clinically.

Our protocols follow FDA guidance for endovascular AAA devices, typically pursuing the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices.

ivc-filter-testing,IVC Filter Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Peripheral Vascular Testing,/preclinical-services/peripheral-vascular-testing,IVC Filter Testing Services,"Successful IVC filters must capture life-threatening clots traveling toward the lungs while preserving venous blood flow back to the heart, resist migration in high-volume flow, and allow safe retrieval weeks or months later. We test clot capture efficiency across different clot sizes, measure venous flow obstruction, quantify retrieval forces after extended deployment, and validate that your filter remains stable without perforating the vena cava wall.",What We Test,"IVC filters face a paradox that defines their challenge. The device must catch clots that could cause fatal pulmonary embolism, yet those same struts or wires that capture emboli also obstruct the venous flow needed to return blood to the heart. Capture too much and you create venous congestion. Miss fragments and you fail to prevent embolism. The filter must also anchor securely in a vessel that carries enormous blood volume without tilting, migrating, or perforating through the vessel wall.

We test IVC filters using venous flow simulators that replicate inferior vena cava hemodynamics with flow rates up to 5 liters per minute. Synthetic clots of varying sizes challenge your filter's capture efficiency while flow sensors measure pressure gradients that indicate venous obstruction. We track filter position under pulsatile flow to detect migration or tilting, measure the force required to retrieve your device after simulated implantation periods, and validate that retrieval hooks or mechanisms remain accessible. Testing includes both permanent filters designed for indefinite placement and retrievable designs across the range of IVC diameters encountered clinically, from 15mm to 30mm vessel sizes.

Our protocols align with FDA guidance for IVC filter devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Testing demonstrates adequate clot capture for pulmonary embolism prevention, minimal venous flow obstruction, secure positioning without perforation risk, and reliable retrieval for temporary designs.

embolic-protection-testing,Embolic Protection Testing Services | GLP Preclinical CRO | Synchrony Labs,Peripheral Vascular Testing,/preclinical-services/peripheral-vascular-testing,Embolic Protection Testing Services,"Successful embolic protection requires devices that capture plaque debris without blocking blood flow to critical organs, contain all captured material during retrieval, and deploy reliably in the seconds available during high-risk procedures. We test particle capture efficiency down to 40 microns, measure flow obstruction at the filter, validate debris retention during device collapse and removal, and confirm your system deploys accurately in tortuous vascular anatomy.",What We Test,"Embolic protection devices face competing demands that make testing critical. Your filter or occlusion system must catch particles that could cause stroke, heart attack, or organ damage, yet the same pores or mechanisms that capture debris also restrict blood flow to tissue that depends on continuous perfusion. Deploy too slowly and emboli escape before protection activates. Retrieve carelessly and captured debris spills back into circulation. The device must accomplish all this during procedures where seconds matter and anatomical access may be challenging.

We test embolic protection devices using programmable debris generators that release controlled quantities of synthetic particles sized from 40 microns to 5 millimeters. High-speed imaging tracks what your filter captures versus what passes through, while flow sensors measure pressure gradients that indicate perfusion compromise. We validate that your device deploys within the time window available during actual procedures, test debris retention as the filter collapses for retrieval, and confirm that captured material remains contained during catheter withdrawal. Testing covers distal filter systems used in carotid and peripheral interventions, proximal occlusion devices for cerebral protection, and specialized designs for specific anatomical territories across vessel diameters from 3mm to 8mm.

Our protocols align with FDA guidance for embolic protection devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices.
