      "primaryContentTitle": "What We Test",
      "primaryContentDescription": "Device materials interact with blood, tissue, and immune systems in ways that standard engineering tests cannot predict. Biocompatibility testing measures whether your materials damage cells in laboratory culture, whether they trigger immune responses that cause inflammation or allergic reactions, and whether blood clots form when it contacts your device surface. These biological responses determine patient safety and regulatory approval for any device that touches human tissue.\n\nWe test cytotoxicity by exposing cells to your device materials and measuring cell death or metabolic damage. Hemocompatibility protocols measure platelet activation, complement system triggering, and clot formation when blood contacts device surfaces. Sensitization studies determine whether materials cause allergic reactions, while systemic toxicity testing evaluates effects on organs and body systems after device implantation.\n\nISO 10993 establishes the testing framework FDA requires, with specific protocols selected based on how long your device contacts tissue and where it's used in the body. Blood-contacting devices require hemocompatibility testing that surface-contact devices don't need. Permanent implants require long-term tissue response studies. We design testing matrices that address your specific device characteristics while meeting the standards FDA reviewers expect to see.",

      "primaryContentDescription": "Carotid stents face a unique challenge that doesn't exist in other vascular territories. The plaque you're treating is the same material that causes stroke if fragments break loose. Your device must compress unstable plaque against the vessel wall, maintain that compression long-term, and accomplish both without releasing particles into cerebral circulation. This requires testing that tracks embolic generation during every phase of deployment while verifying that the stent provides adequate vessel scaffolding.\n\nWe test carotid stents using anatomically accurate carotid bifurcation models with pulsatile flow systems that replicate cerebral circulation patterns. High-resolution particle tracking captures debris released during deployment and expansion, measuring both size and quantity of embolic material. Flow velocity measurement confirms adequate cerebral perfusion throughout the procedure, while radial force testing validates that your stent maintains plaque compression under arterial pressure. We evaluate both self-expanding nitinol designs and balloon-expandable systems across different stenosis severities and plaque compositions.\n\nOur protocols align with FDA guidance for carotid stent devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Testing demonstrates embolic safety during deployment, adequate revascularization of the stenosed segment, and maintained vessel patency over time. We measure performance against ISO 25539 standards for cardiovascular stents, with specific emphasis on cerebrovascular safety parameters that distinguish carotid applications from coronary or peripheral use.",

      "primaryContentDescription": "Watchman devices represent the established standard for percutaneous LAA closure, requiring validation that addresses nitinol framework expansion, polyester fabric membrane sealing, and sizing accuracy across diverse appendage geometries. These self-expanding occluders must demonstrate controlled deployment, adequate wall apposition force, and complete appendage isolation while supporting endothelialization that prevents thrombus formation. Success depends on validating framework durability under cardiac loading, membrane integrity throughout device lifetime, and optimal sizing across the spectrum of LAA anatomical variations.\n\nWe evaluate framework performance using specialized expansion testing that quantifies radial force, shape memory recovery, and deployment consistency across temperature ranges. Our catheterization laboratories feature transesophageal echocardiography capabilities, anatomical models representing chicken wing through windsock morphologies, and flow measurement systems that assess sealing effectiveness. From nitinol fatigue characterization to fabric endothelialization studies, our protocols address the specific validation requirements Watchman platforms demand.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide nitinol and fabric material assessment while device specific protocols address compression ratio optimization and anchoring stability validation. Our GLP compliant testing supports both 510(k) pathways for devices demonstrating substantial equivalence to established Watchman predicates and PMA submissions for significant design modifications. Whether validating next generation framework designs or novel fabric configurations, our protocols address FDA expectations for LAA closure devices across intended patient populations.",
