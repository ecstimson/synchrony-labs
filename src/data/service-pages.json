    "primaryContentDescription": "Cardiac pacemakers sustain life through reliable electrical stimulation, requiring validation that demonstrates consistent sensing, appropriate pacing, and battery longevity across varying physiological conditions. Pacemakers must detect intrinsic cardiac activity while delivering therapy that maintains adequate heart rate without depleting battery reserves prematurely. Single-chamber systems demand precise ventricular pacing validation while dual-chamber platforms require complex atrial-ventricular synchronization assessment and rate-responsive devices need sensor algorithm verification across activity levels.\n\nWe evaluate electrical performance using specialized electrophysiology systems that capture pacing thresholds, sensing amplitudes, and impedance measurements with microsecond precision. Our catheterization laboratories feature programmable cardiac simulation systems enabling comprehensive pacing mode assessment and rate adaptation testing. Lead system testing evaluates conductor durability through accelerated fatigue protocols while biocompatibility assessment addresses chronic tissue contact requirements using ISO 10993 standards adapted for active implantable devices.\n\nISO 14708 series standards guide cardiac pacemaker assessment while FDA guidance documents for active implantable medical devices inform protocol development addressing electromagnetic compatibility, battery performance, and MRI conditional validation. Our GLP-compliant testing supports both 510(k) pathways demonstrating substantial equivalence and PMA submissions for breakthrough technologies. Whether validating traditional dual-chamber systems, leadless pacemaker platforms, or MRI-conditional devices, our protocols demonstrate electrical reliability, sensing accuracy, and long-term biocompatibility performance that regulatory submissions demand.",

Small positioning errors cause permanent pacemaker needs or dangerous leaks. We test whether your valve expands uniformly, whether balloon-inflatable frames maintain position during inflation, and whether self-expanding systems provide consistent radial force.\n\nWe measure deployment precision using biplane fluoroscopy that captures valve positioning from multiple angles. Our aortic root models range from normal anatomy to severely calcified bicuspid valves where standard TAVR approaches fail. Pulse duplicator systems measure pressure gradients across your valve while flow imaging reveals paravalvular leak patterns. We quantify coronary ostia clearance, conduction bundle proximity, and sealing effectiveness.\n\nISO 5840 standards guide our TAVR testing protocols. FDA guidance documents for transcatheter aortic valves inform our study designs, ensuring we generate the hemodynamic benchmarks and safety data your PMA or 510(k) requires. Our GLP-compliant testing addresses balloon-expandable and self-expanding platforms, standard TAVR procedures, and specialized applications including valve-in-valve implantation.",

    "heroDescription": "Successful IVC filters must capture life-threatening clots traveling toward the lungs while preserving venous blood flow back to the heart, resist migration in high-volume flow, and allow safe retrieval weeks or months later.

    "primaryContentTitle": "What We Test",
    "primaryContentDescription": "IVC filters face a paradox that defines their challenge. The device must catch clots that could cause fatal pulmonary embolism, yet those same struts or wires that capture emboli also obstruct the venous flow needed to return blood to the heart. Capture too much and you create venous congestion. Miss fragments and you fail to prevent embolism. The filter must also anchor securely in a vessel that carries enormous blood volume without tilting, migrating, or perforating through the vessel wall.\n\nWe test IVC filters using venous flow simulators that replicate inferior vena cava hemodynamics with flow rates up to 5 liters per minute. Synthetic clots of varying sizes challenge your filter's capture efficiency while flow sensors measure pressure gradients that indicate venous obstruction. We track filter position under pulsatile flow to detect migration or tilting, measure the force required to retrieve your device after simulated implantation periods, and validate that retrieval hooks or mechanisms remain accessible. Testing includes both permanent filters designed for indefinite placement and retrievable designs across the range of IVC diameters encountered clinically, from 15mm to 30mm vessel sizes.\n\nOur protocols align with FDA guidance for IVC filter devices, typically following the 510(k) pathway with substantial equivalence to predicate devices. Testing demonstrates adequate clot capture for pulmonary embolism prevention, minimal venous flow obstruction, secure positioning without perforation risk, and reliable retrieval for temporary designs. We measure performance against ISO 25539 standards for cardiovascular implants, with specific emphasis on venous safety parameters and retrieval system reliability.",

High-speed imaging tracks what your filter captures versus what passes through, while flow sensors measure pressure gradients that indicate perfusion compromise. We validate that your device deploys within the time window available during actual procedures, test debris retention as the filter collapses for retrieval, and confirm that captured material remains contained during catheter withdrawal.

    "heroDescription": "Successful laparoscopic surgery requires instruments where electrical insulation never fails during tissue cutting, trocar seals maintain pneumoperitoneum throughout procedures, and articulation joints deliver precise movements after thousands of cycles. We test whether your electrosurgical insulation withstands the mechanical stress of tissue manipulation, measure how much force surgeons need to actuate your instrument, and validate that seals prevent gas leakage under the pressure conditions surgeons actually encounter.",
    "primaryContentTitle": "What We Test",
    "primaryContentDescription": "Laparoscopic instruments combine mechanical precision with electrical safety in an environment where insulation failure can cause serious patient injury. Electrosurgical devices must deliver cutting or coagulation energy while maintaining complete insulation integrity along shaft lengths of 30-45cm. Articulating instruments must transmit hand movements through multiple joints without backlash or position drift. Trocars must seal around instruments of varying diameters while maintaining 12-15 mmHg insufflation pressure. All components must survive repeated sterilization cycles without performance degradation.\n\nWe measure insulation resistance per IEC 60601 standards, applying mechanical stress while monitoring for current leakage that could cause patient burns. Mechanical testing quantifies actuation forces at the handle, jaw closure forces at the tip, and whether articulation accuracy degrades after 5,000+ cycles. We validate trocar seal performance across instrument diameter ranges, measure CO2 leak rates during simulated instrument exchanges, and verify that valve mechanisms maintain function after repeated autoclaving. Testing addresses general surgery, gynecological, and urological applications.\n\nYour device typically follows a 510(k) pathway demonstrating substantial equivalence to predicate instruments. We provide testing that addresses FDA guidance on electrosurgical safety, mechanical performance verification, and biocompatibility assessment for peritoneal tissue contact per ISO 10993. Our protocols generate the comparative data and safety documentation regulators expect for laparoscopic instrument clearances.",
