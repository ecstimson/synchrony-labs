    "primaryContentDescription": "Heart failure devices sustain life when cardiac function deteriorates, requiring validation that demonstrates both mechanical performance and therapeutic benefit. LVADs must maintain continuous flow across varying preload and afterload conditions while preventing hemolysis, platelet activation, and thrombotic complications. Cardiac resynchronization therapy devices need precise pacing algorithms that restore ventricular synchrony and improve ejection fraction. Temporary support systems require rapid deployment validation and stable performance during acute decompensation events.\n\nWe evaluate pump performance using pressure-volume loop analysis and real-time flow monitoring that captures hemodynamic responses across physiological stress conditions. Our catheterization laboratories feature continuous cardiac output measurement, ventricular pressure monitoring, and echocardiographic imaging that tracks device-heart interactions throughout complete cardiac cycles. Hemocompatibility testing quantifies hemolysis indices, platelet function, and von Willebrand factor degradation using ISO 10993-4 protocols adapted for rotary blood pump assessment.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide chronic implantation assessment while device-specific protocols address pump durability, electrical performance validation for CRT systems, and anatomical integration for surgical implants. Whether validating next-generation continuous-flow LVADs, percutaneous temporary support devices, or biventricular assist systems, our GLP-compliant testing addresses both PMA pathway requirements and post-market surveillance objectives.",

    "primaryContentTitle": "What We Test",
    "primaryContentDescription": "Coronary stent development requires validation that addresses mechanical performance, biological safety, and therapeutic efficacy across diverse platform types. Drug-eluting stents face additional complexity as combination products requiring integrated assessment of device mechanics, polymer coating performance, and pharmacological activity. Whether validating bare metal platforms through radial strength and biocompatibility testing or characterizing drug-eluting systems with complex elution profiles, successful regulatory submissions demand comprehensive preclinical data addressing FDA expectations for both immediate performance and long-term vascular healing.\n\nWe evaluate mechanical integrity through radial force measurement, crush resistance assessment, and accelerated durability protocols that simulate years of cardiac loading. Our catheterization laboratories feature high-resolution fluoroscopy and intravascular ultrasound capabilities enabling deployment characterization in anatomically accurate coronary models. For drug-eluting platforms, specialized analytical systems quantify drug release kinetics through HPLC analysis while tissue distribution studies map therapeutic agent penetration patterns in vessel walls. Polymer coating assessment utilizes scanning electron microscopy and advanced imaging techniques identifying uniformity, adhesion characteristics, and structural integrity throughout deployment sequences.\n\nISO 10993 biocompatibility standards guide material evaluation while ISO 25539 specifications inform mechanical testing protocols for vascular stents. Drug-eluting platforms require additional FDA guidance consideration addressing combination product requirements, drug-specific toxicology, and polymer biocompatibility assessment. Our testing addresses both 510(k) substantial equivalence demonstrations and PMA pathway requirements for breakthrough technologies, providing complete validation packages supporting regulatory submissions across bare metal designs, established drug-eluting platforms, bioresorbable scaffolds, and novel therapeutic combinations.",
